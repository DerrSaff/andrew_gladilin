# Saff'a
This is my personal web-site.

You can read a little bit about me and my activities.

I am also going to translate useful articles about IT that will be placed in the blog (it's not done yet).

There is a [Kanban board](https://tree.taiga.io/project/derrsaff-saffa/kanban) reflecting my development progress.

I like to talk to new people so feel free to contact me if you suddenly liked something I did or have thoughts to share.
